My solo project incorporating a back-end using Java, Spring Boot, IntelliJ/Eclipse with Hibernate/JPA for interacting with MySQL database. Postman used for API testing. And JS/React for front-end.

The **Customer Relationship Management (CRM)** system designed for FDM account managers aims to streamline the process of placing potential candidates into job positions within companies. This system enhances efficiency and effectiveness by offering functionalities for candidate management, job tracking, client interaction, and reporting.

The system comprises five main tables: users, leads, jobs, potcandidates, and contacts.

- Users: Contains a list of account managers utilizing the CRM system.
- Leads: Stores contacts associated with job opportunities pursued by FDM account managers.
- Jobs: Lists available job opportunities requiring placement.
- Contacts: Provides contact information for corporate clients offering job opportunities.
- Potcandidates: Contains potential candidates open to placement.
